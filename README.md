# Hey, I'm Nick 👋

**Perth, Australia** 🇦🇺 • **AI Toolsmith**

I build practical AI developer infrastructure: context engineering, agent orchestration, and small tools that remove friction.

## What I Build

- **Context engineering & memory systems** (turn “chat” into durable engineering)
- **Multi-agent orchestration** (coordination patterns that scale)
- **MCP servers & integrations** (bridge tools to LLM workflows)
- **Developer utilities** (small, sharp tools that ship)

## Philosophy

> Work counts. Credentials are optional. Ship tools that solve real problems — the stars follow.

> If it's missing, build it. Ship it fast!

> Work on solving hard problems.

> The pipeline is the product. The UI is optional.
